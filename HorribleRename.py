	f_list = sorted(os.listdir(path)) 							# Fetches all files in the given directory and stores them in files.
	#print(f_list) 												# Prints all the files in the list.

		container = name['container'] 							# File extention type
		newTitle = (title+'-'+epNum+'.'+container) 				# Creates Plex friendly title
		os.rename(files,newTitle) 								# Renames target files using new_name.
